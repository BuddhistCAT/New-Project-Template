# HOW-TO: One-Time Integration Between Github and Transifex

Note that this has to be done only once. It is required to do this before you can create your first project. It will take about 2-3 minutes to complete these steps.

## Step-by-Step

1) Go to this [page](https://github.com/apps/transifex-integration/installations/new) on Github to start the process
2) From the dialogue that opens, make sure that `All repositories` is selected and click the green button `Install`

**NOTE**: Having completed the above steps, you will end up on a Github page where nothing needs to be done, and where the save button is dimmed. This is all ok and having reached that point,  you can move to the next step.

3) Go to this [page](https://www.transifex.com/lotus-king-trust/settings/integrations/) on Transifex and click the text link that says `Authorize` to open additional options
4) From the new options that open, click `authorize Transifex` text link and ignore everything else
5) Click the big green button that says "Authorize..." from the dialogue that opens
6) From the selection that opens next, select the Github organization that you want to integrate Transifex with
